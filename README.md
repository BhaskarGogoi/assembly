## Introduction

Various questions on various topics on various sectors and to know the status, future
plans of any scheme/projects etc. generally these questions are placed by an Hon’ble
Minister/MLA during the Assembly Session period. And the status report is collected by
sending the question in the banner of Assembly Question (AQ) to the concerned
Department/ District Administration and Sub-divisional Administration.

Sometimes it has been noticed that there is a delay in report submission by the user
department and this may be due to non-receipt of the message/question or oversight of the
question due to large flow of mail each and every day.

To overcome the delay at either end including the Assembly question/message
delivery and submission of the report in time, the concept of “Assembly Question Tracking
Management System” has been conceptualized.
